# 📢 Select & Speak 

This is my first browser extension so I went with a simple concept, a TTS extension using Chrome’s built-in Text-to-Speech API



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3)


## ✨ Why this project?
TTS is available as an accessibility feature in almost every device nowadays, but this extension makes it easier for light use in websites.
